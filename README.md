# NotepadLauncher-v0.1
Thanks for downloading my NotepadLauncher program! This is my first project so sorry if it sucks.

This program will open the terminal, ask if you want to open Notepad but then proceed to type yes anyways.
It will then open notepad and start typing a special message! 

Make sure you have .NET installed (https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/thank-you/sdk-10.0.102-windows-x64-installer)
